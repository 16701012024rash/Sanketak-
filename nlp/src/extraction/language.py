"""
Which language is this report written in?

Deliberately dependency-free and script-based rather than a statistical
detector. Field reports are short — often a single line — and general-purpose
language detectors are unreliable on short strings and on code-mixed text,
which is exactly the case that matters here. Unicode ranges are boring and
they do not misfire.

Assamese and Bengali share a script, so a script check cannot separate them.
That is fine for our purpose: OIL's Assam operations are the relevant case, and
either way the text routes down the same path.
